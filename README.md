# Kafka Producer Test #

This is some code testing the new [Kafka Producer API](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerapi)
introduced in Kafka 0.8.2 using Scala.

Easiest way to test this is to just clone this repo, then run [this](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/devdb/kafka/)
docker container for a development Kafka node with the following:
```
docker pull devdb/kafka:latest
sudo docker run -d --net host --name kafka -p 2181:2181 -p 9092:9092 devdb/kafka
sudo docker exec -it kafka bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --from-beginning --topic test
```
This will start up Kafka and start consuming the topic test to the console.

The open another terminal and run the test code:
```
./activator "run 1234"
```

If everything works this should produce **1234** events on the Kafka topic **test** which the should be
consumed and outputted in the other terminal.
